# Management of the site - How To

## Configuration

You have to customize the following parameters in `_config.yml`:

- title: the name of your team.
- subtitle: the running title.
- email: the contact email.
- short_desc: the title of the banner in the index page.
- long_desc: the content of the banner in the index page.
- expiration_opportunities: the job offers will expire automatically after this number of days.
- expiration_news: the news will expire automatically after this number of days.

You can change the banner image in the index page `images/banner.png` and the logo `images/logo.png`.

Then you will need to fill the collections in `_collections` (only text files).
Please look at the example and use the same keys.

Note: For the research collection, you will have to add a new `research_<CATEGORY>.md` for new categories.

## How to Use

For those unfamiliar with how Jekyll works, check out [https://jekyllrb.com/](https://jekyllrb.com/) for all the details,
or read up on just the basics of [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/), [writing posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/),
and [creating pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/).

- **GitLab**: Simply fork this repository and start editing the `_config.yml` file!
- **GitHub**: Fork this repository and create a branch named `gh-pages`, then start editing the `_config.yml` file! The `.gitlab-ci.yml` file is only needed for GitLab Pages, so feel free to delete this if you are using GitHub instead.

Say hello to Editorial, a blog/magazine-ish template built around a toggleable "locking"
sidebar (scroll down to see what I mean) and an accordion-style menu. Not the usual landing
page/portfolio affair you'd expect to see at HTML5 UP, but I figured for my 41st (!!!)
template I'd change it up a little. Enjoy :)
